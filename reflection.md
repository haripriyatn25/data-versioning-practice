## What I Did
I learned how to set up a GitHub repository, add files, make commits, and view version history.  
I practiced basic version control by adding a Python script and README file.

## Why Version Control Matters
Git and GitHub make collaboration easier, track every change, and ensure that previous versions can always be recovered.

## Challenges
- Understanding how remotes work between local and online repositories.  
- Remembering Git commands (init, add, commit, push).

## What I Learned
- How to commit changes and manage versions.
- How to document projects using README files.
- How GitHub repositories can serve as public portfolios for code.
